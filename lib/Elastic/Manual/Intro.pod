=head1 POSSIBLE FUTURE OF ELASTIC::MODEL - PLEASE READ

Clinton Gormley, author of Elastic::Model have said about the future of this lib:

    Hi all users of Elastic::Model

    Elasticsearch 2.0.0 is out, and Elastic::Model doesn't support it.
    In fact, Elastic::Model doesn't support a number of things from
    Elasticsearch 1.x either. I apologise for neglecting this module.

    My feeling is that Elastic::Model tries to do way too much.
    Like many frameworks, it ties you into doing things in a
    particular way, which may or may not make sense for your use
    case. Most people who use Elastic::Model seem to use a
    subset of the functionality, and then talk to Elasticsearch
    directly the rest of the time.

    I don't think it makes sense to just update the code for
    2.x, it needs a complete rethink.

    TELL ME HOW YOU USE IT

    Please could you add comments to
    L<this issue|https://github.com/clintongormley/Elastic-Model/issues/42>
    explaining what bits you find useful, what bits you never use,
    and what bits you find annoying. Perhaps the code can be split
    out into smaller more useful chunks.

Only L<a few of Us told him how we use it|https://github.com/clintongormley/Elastic-Model/issues/42>
and from my point of view, after reading there and talking with other users,
Clinton is right when he says that Elastic::Model is doing too much...
I've started to make some minimal changes to make it work with 2.4 and it
was really easy to make our company code work on top of this patched version,
but a lot of tests were failing and working on this I've discovered things
that we don't use and will never use, and probably I don't understand.

I was able to make all tests to pass using Elasticsearch 2.4.0 and 1.7.4.

On the other hand I've discovered that maintaining support for 0.9 will be a
harder work that I'm not interested to do, so I did completely removed support
for it and try and I'm trying to reach a point where I can request Clinton to
merge my changes to make a new CPAN release supporting 2.x possible.

I would be very happy if some other users can test their code on this branch
and I'm very open to receive any help.

=head1 INSTALLING REQUIREMENTS

=head2 Install Elasticsearch

You need a recent version of Java installed, then download the current
stable release of Elasticsearch from L<http://www.Elasticsearch.org/download/>.
For instance:

    curl -L -O https://github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-2.4.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzf elasticsearch-2.4.0.tar.gz

B<< Note: This version of Elastic::Model is intended for Elasticsearch 2.x and
can be used with Elasticsearch 1.x setting the 1.x client on initialization.
See L<Elastic::Manual::Delta> for more details. >>

=head2 Install Elastic::Model

Use your favourite CPAN installer:

    cpanm Elastic::Model

See L<Elastic::Manual/TEST SUITE> for how to run the full test suite
against a local Elasticsearch cluster.

=head2 Start Elasticsearch

    cd elasticsearch-2.4.0/
    ./bin/elasticsearch       # -d starts the server in the background

You now have a running Elasticsearch cluster with one node. You can test that
it is running with:

    curl http://localhost:9200/?pretty=true

See L<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html>
for more information about installing and configuring Elasticsearch.

=head1 SETUP YOUR APPLICATION

=head2 Create a Model

First set up a simple L<model|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Model>.  The model
handles the relationship between your classes and Elasticsearch.

    package MyApp;

    use Elastic::Model;

    has_namespace 'myapp' => {
        user    => 'MyApp::User'
    };

    no Elastic::Model;

    1;

Your model must define at least one L<namespace|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Namespace>,
which tells Elastic::Model which
L<type|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Type> (like a table in a DB) should be
handled by which of your classes.  So the above declaration says:

I<"For all L<indices|Elastic::Model::Terminology/Index> which belong to namespace
C<myapp>, objects of class C<MyApp::User> will be stored under the
L<type|Elastic::Model::Terminology/Type> C<user> in Elasticsearch.">

=head2 Create your User class

    package MyApp::User;

    use Elastic::Doc;

    use DateTime();

    has 'name' => (
        is  => 'rw',
        isa => 'Str',
    );

    has 'email' => (
        is  => 'rw',
        isa => 'Str',
    );

    has 'created' => (
        is      => 'ro',
        isa     => 'DateTime',
        default => sub { DateTime->now }
    );

    no Elastic::Doc;

    1;

This simple Moose class only changes "C<use Moose;>" to "C<use Elastic::Doc;>".
At the moment we're not configuring anything else. Thanks to Moose's
introspection, we have enough information to setup everything we need.

=head1 PREPARING TO USE YOUR APPLICATION

=head2 Connect your Model to an Elasticsearch cluster

    #!/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use MyApp();

    my $model  = MyApp->new();

This creates an instance of your model, with a connection to a local
Elasticsearch cluster.  The last line is the equivalent of:

    use Search::Elasticsearch();
    my $es     = Search::Elasticsearch->new(
        nodes => 'localhost:9200'
    );
    my $model  = MyApp->new( es => $es );

=head2 Create an index

Before we get started, we need to create an
L<index|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Index> (like a database in a relational DB)
in Elasticsearch.

    $model->namespace('myapp')->index->create();

This has created index C<myapp>, which contains
L<type|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Type> C<user> (where a type is like a
table in a database). It has also configured the type's
L<mapping|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Mapping> (which is like the schema
or column definition).

Our index is now ready to use.

=head1 STORING AND RETRIEVING OBJECTS

=head2 Preparation for object access

Before we can save or retrieve objects/documents from Elasticsearch, we need
a C<domain>:

=head3 Get a domain

A L<domain|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Domain> is like a database handle. It
allows us to talk to a particular index or
L<alias|Elastic::Manual::Terminology/Alias>.  (An alias is like a shortcut
which points at one or more indices.)

    $domain = $model->domain('myapp');

See L<Elastic::Manual::Scaling> for more about how to use aliases.

=head2 Create an object

Normally, you would create an object with:

    my $user = MyApp::User->new(...)

but to use all of the magic of Elastic::Model, you must create your object
via the C<$domain> object:

    my $user    = $domain->new_doc(
        user => {                           # $type => \%args_to_new
            id    => 1,                     # auto-generated if not provided
            name  => 'Clinton',
            email => 'clint@domain.com',
        }
    );

    $user->save;                            # save to Elasticsearch

=head2 Retrieve an object by ID

Now, we can retrieve the user object from Elasticsearch, using the
C<type> and C<id>:

    $user = $domain->get( user => 1 );

    say $user->name;
    # Clinton

=head2 Update your object

    $user->email( 'clinton@domain.com' );

Elastic::Model keeps track of what attributes have been changed, plus their
original value:

    say $user->has_changed;
    # 1

    say $user->has_changed('email');
    # 1

    dump $user->old_values;
    # { email => 'clint@domain.com' };

The L<UID|Elastic::Model::UID> (unique ID) of the object tracks (amongst other
things) the current version number. Elasticsearch uses this version
number to avoid overwriting changes that have been made by another process
(see L<Optimistic Currency Control|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control>).

    say $user->uid->version;
    # 1

The version number is incremented each time a changed object is saved.

    $user->save;

    say $user->uid->version;
    # 2

    say $user->has_changed;
    # 0

=head1 QUERYING Elasticsearch

By default, everything in Elasticsearch is indexed and searchable. You can
search across one index or many indices, one type or many types.

In order to query the objects stored in Elasticsearch, you need a
L<view|Elastic::Model::View>. Views are reusable, so you might create views
like C<$recent_users>, C<$approved_comments> etc.

=head2 Creating a view

You can create a C<view> from your C<$domain> object, in which case the view
will be limited to just that domain:

    $view = $domain->view;              # limited to index 'myapp';

To create a view which queries multiple domains, you could do:

    $view = $model->view->domain(['index_1', 'alias_2']);

Or to query all domains known to your model:

    $view = $model->view;

=head2 Configuring a view

When setting an attribute on a view, a cloned instance of the old view is
returned, meaning that you can use one view to derive another:

    $all   = $domain->view;                         # all types in $domain
    $users = $all->type('user');                    # type 'user' in index $domain
    $clint = $users->queryb({name => 'clinton'});   # users whose name is 'clinton'

=head2 Query syntax

Queries can be specified using the standard
L<Elasticsearch query DSL|http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html>
or with the more Perlish more compact L<ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder> syntax.

Standard query DSL:

    $search = $view->query( { text =>  { name    => 'clinton' }})
                   ->filter({ range => { created => { gt => '2012-01-01' }}});

SearchBuilder syntax:

    $search = $view->queryb(  { name    => 'clinton'             })
                   ->filterb( { created => { gt => '2012-01-01' }});

=head2 Getting search results

Once you have defined your view, you call a search method (eg
L<search()|Elastic::Model::View/"search()">) which performs
the search and returns a L<Results|Elastic::Model::Results> object.

    my $results = $search->search;
    say "Total results found: ".$results->total;

    while (my $doc = $results->next_doc) {
        say $doc->name
    }

Views can also be used to return highlighted results, and
L<aggregations|http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html>,
which provide aggregated results, much like GROUP-BY functions in SQL, for
instance, the most popular terms, or the number of posting per day.
